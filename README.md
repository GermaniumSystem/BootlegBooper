# DEFCON Furs DC27 Bootleg Badge Face

This year's DCFurs badge is a bit different - it has a PCB "host" and an acrylic overlay "face".
After learning this, I couldn't help but wonder if I could make my own face. I could certainly make one after DEF CON, but that's no fun.
So, I deduced as many measurements as I could from the teasers, made some potato-spec pixel art based on the DC26 badge, and sent it.

This bootleg overlay also features two GPIO items: a buzzer and a switch.

Will it fit? Will it look like shit? Who knows!


## Usage

Guidance on how to build and use the bootleg booper will be added after I get a badge.


## Behind the Scenes

### How did I do?
| Things that keep me up at night | Result |
| ---- | ---- |
| Did the boards arrive on time? | Yes. |
| Did I screw up the gerbers? | No... Ok, maybe a little. |
| Did the fab screw up my gerbers? | No. |
| Does it fit? | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Are the holes the right size? | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Did I need to break out the drill and/or file? | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Do the LEDs shine through the board enough? | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Are the GPIO pins even implemented on the badge? | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Does the SAO ribbon cable work? | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Is the SAO ribbon cable pinout correct? | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Does the buzzer work? | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Is the buzzer off by default? | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Does the switch work? | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Does the boop sensor work through the face? | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |
| Does the badge break spec and run at 5v instead of 3.3 again? | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ |

| 19-07-22 | Digikey order placed. | High again. |
| 19-07-23 | Digikey order shipped. | Lower again. |
| 19-07-23 | AllPCB arrival date missed. | Meh. Saw it coming. |
| 19-07-24 | AllPCB order arrives. | Knees weak, arms are heavy. |

### Schematics
Schematics for will be added after DEF CON. Probably.
